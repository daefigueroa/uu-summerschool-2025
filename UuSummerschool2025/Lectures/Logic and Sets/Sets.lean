In Mathlib, a set of elements of `α` is a predicate with domain `α`,
i.e. a function `p : α → Prop`. The idea is that for some `x : α`,
`p a` should be true if `a` is in the set and false otherwise.

We denote the type of all such functions by `Set α`.
If we regard `α` as iteslf being a set, then the type `Set α`
is the power set of `α`. -/

def Set (α : Type*) := (α → Prop)

variable {α : Type*}

/--
Interpret a predicate `p : α → Prop` as a set.
 -/
def setOf (p : α → Prop) : Set α := p

/--
Given a set `s : Set α` and a `x : α`, `Set.mem s x` is proposition
that `x` is an element of `s`.
 -/
def Set.mem (s : Set α) (x : α) : Prop := s x

/-- Enable `∈` notation. -/

  mem := Set.mem

This says that Set.mem is really just the proposition that the set is
defined to be

/-
The following gives an error when uncommented. This is because
even though `Set α` and `α → Prop` are the same under the hood,
lean wants you to have something of type `Set α` in order for the
`∈` notation to work.

--example (x : α) (s : α → Prop) : x ∈ s ↔ s x := Iff.rfl


/-
When defining new data structures, we often write "extensionality"
lemmas (usually denoted with `_.ext`). These say that "two things are the same
if they contain the same stuff".

For example, we have `funext`, which says that two functions `f g : α → β`
are equal if `f x = g x` for all `x : α`.

We also have `propext`, which says that two propositions `a` and `b` are
equal if `a ↔ b`.

We're going to show an extensionality lemma for sets `Set.ext`,
which says that two sets are equal iff they have the same elements.

/-
We can make our own notation using the *notation* keyword. Here,
we're making a notation which resembles the familiar set builder notation.

Note that lean already has a built in set builder notation, so we've added
this funny `my` at the start so that lean doesn't complain.
-/
notation "my{" x " | " p "}" => setOf fun x => p

#check my{(n : Nat) | 0 < n}

Write the following common set operations using our set builder notation:

def Set.union (s t : Set α) : Set α := sorry

def Set.inter (s t : Set α) : Set α := sorry

From this point on we have exited the `MyDefs` namespace and are just
working with the existing `Set` library in lean. This is just so we have
access to more lemmas so we can prove more interesting statements, the
lean library under the hood looks more or less like what we've developed
above.
-/


variable {α β : Type*} (s t u : Set α)

/-
The following is a fairly simple set theory lemma, and we're going to prove
it in a few different ways
-/

example (h : s ⊆ t) : s ∩ u ⊆ t ∩ u := sorry
  /-
  We can prove this in a verbose style, by using rw? to guide us
  -/


example (h : s ⊆ t) : s ∩ u ⊆ t ∩ u := sorry
  /-
  In fact, we do not need to explicitly unfold the definitions here,
  we can just use intro directly here, and we can even use a fun constructor
  called *rintro*, which allows us to pattern match on elements we're introducing.
  -/



example (h : s ⊆ t) : s ∩ u ⊆ t ∩ u :=
  /-
  This must exist somewhere in the library, so we can also
  solve this problem by trying to find this lemma using
  tools like `rw?`, `exact?`, `apply?`, `loogle` or `leansearch`.
  -/
  sorry

/-
To prove set theoretic statements using logic, it often helps to turn them
into statements about *membership*, for which our `ext` lemma we proved before
can be helpful.

The `ext` tactics applies relevant `ext` lemmas in the given context. We can then
prove this statement using only `mem_union` and `Or.comm`.
-/
example : s ∪ t = t ∪ s := sorry


/-! ## Functions -/

/-
So far we have seen the `→` symbol used for implications, but it can also
be used to denote functions! In fact, this is more than just a notational
trick, as we have seen under the hood these are really the same thing.
-/
variable (f : α → β)

/-
Here we can define function composition, and notice how it's exactly
the same as proving the transitivity of implication.
-/
example {γ : Type*} (g : α → β) (h : β → γ) : α → γ := sorry

#check Set.preimage
example (s : Set β) : f ⁻¹' s = {x | f x ∈ s} := rfl

#check Set.image
example (s : Set α) : f '' s = {y | ∃ x, x ∈ s ∧ f x = y} := rfl


/-
The following lemmas are quite useful when working with images and
preimages
-/
#check Set.mem_preimage

#check Set.mem_image

/-
Here is a simple statement about preimages of sets. To give a sense of how
much more powerful lean's `rfl` tactic is than its counterpart in the natural
numbers game, we note that this lemma can actually be proven by `rfl`.

To make this slightly more interesting, let's try and prove this just using the
following limited set of lemmas:

`union_def`
`setOf_or`
`mem_setOf`
`mem_union`
`Set.mem_preimage`

We're also allowed to use tactics like `rw`, `apply`, `unfold`, `ext` and so on
(but no simp!)
