# Summerschool on Formalising Mathematics in Lean 2025

This is the repository for the summerschool on Formalising Mathematics in Lean at Utrecht University in 2025.
It contains the course material, including lectures, exercises and project sketches.

## Online Lean usage

To try out Lean and to follow the content of the first day, you don't need a local Lean installation. Instead,
you can use the [online Lean editor](https://live.lean-lang.org/).

We will also play the [Natural Number Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4) on the
first day to learn the basics of Lean.

## Local installation

From the second day on, to follow the lectures, to do the exercises and to work on projects, you will
need a local Lean installation. The recommended way is to install VS Code
and the Lean extension following the first 3 steps of these
[instructions](https://docs.lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html).

Now, open VS Code and click on the forall symbol on the right hand side of the screen and select
`Open Project > Project: Download Project`:
![download project dialog](images/vscode-download-project.png)

There will appear a text box, in which you copy the following URL:
```
https://github.com/formal-methods-nl/uu-summerschool-2025
```
After selecting a path where the project should be installed on your computer, wait for a few minutes
for everything to download and compile.

You will find the course material in the `UuSummerschool2025` directory.
